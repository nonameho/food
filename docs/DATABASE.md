# Database Schema Documentation

This document describes the database schema for the Food Ordering App.

## Overview

The database uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. The schema is designed to support a multi-restaurant marketplace with customers, restaurant owners, drivers, and administrators.

## Migrations

To create a new migration after changing the schema:

```bash
cd backend
npm run prisma:migrate
```

To reset the database (development only):

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
```

## Seeding

To seed the database with sample data:

```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

Sample data includes:
- 1 admin user
- 3 restaurant owners
- 5 customers
- 2 drivers
- 5 restaurants with menus
- Sample orders and reviews

## Best Practices

### When Adding New Fields
1. Always add `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps
2. Use appropriate data types (Float for prices, Int for counts)
3. Add indexes for foreign keys and frequently queried fields
4. Update TypeScript types in `/shared/types/index.ts`

### When Adding New Tables
1. Always include UUID primary key
2. Add `createdAt` timestamp
3. Add indexes for foreign keys
4. Update relationships in related tables
5. Document the table in this file

### Restaurant Ownership Rule ⚠️
- Restaurant `id` is auto-generated (UUID). Do not override it to equal the owner's ID.
- `ownerId` is unique, ensuring one restaurant per owner. Always set this field when creating a restaurant.

### PromoCode Usage in Orders
When creating an order with a promo code:
1. Include `promoCodeId` in the Order record to track which code was used
2. The `discount` field should reflect the promo code value
3. On successful payment, increment the promo code's `usedCount` to enforce usage limits
4. Always validate that `usedCount < maxUses` before allowing promo code application

**Example**:
```javascript
// When applying a promo code to an order:
const order = await prisma.order.create({
  data: {
    customerId,
    restaurantId,
    promoCodeId: promoCode.id,  // Track which promo code was used
    discount: calculatedDiscount,
    // ... other fields
  },
});

// After successful payment:
await prisma.promoCode.update({
  where: { id: promoCode.id },
  data: {
    usedCount: { increment: 1 },
  },
});
```

**Benefits**:
- Track which promo codes are used
- Enforce maximum usage limits
- Enable analytics on promo code effectiveness
- Identify popular vs. unused codes

### Driver Assignment Pattern ⚠️
**Important**: Drivers are assigned to orders through the Delivery table, not directly on the Order table.

**Correct Pattern** (Access via Delivery):
```javascript
// To get driver for an order:
const order = await prisma.order.findUnique({
  where: { id: orderId },
  include: {
    delivery: {
      include: {
        driver: true,  // Access driver through delivery
      },
    },
  },
});
const driver = order.delivery?.driver;

// To get driver's deliveries:
const deliveries = await prisma.delivery.findMany({
  where: { driverId: driverId },
  include: { order: true },
});
```

**DO NOT** use Order.driverId (field was removed) or Order.deliveredOrders (relation was removed).

**Why this pattern?**:
- Single source of truth (driverId only in Delivery table)
- Eliminates data redundancy
- Ensures consistency across the system
- Orders can exist without drivers (until assigned)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Foreign key constraint fails
**Solution**: Ensure referenced record exists before creating dependent record

**Issue**: Duplicate key violation
**Solution**: Check unique constraints and use upsert operations

**Issue**: Migration conflicts
**Solution**: Reset migrations in development, use `--create-only` for production

**Issue**: Restaurant creation fails with uniqueness errors
**Solution**: Ensure the restaurant name is unique and the owner does not already have a restaurant (`ownerId` is unique).

**Issue**: Promo code usage not tracked
**Solution**: Always set `promoCodeId` on orders to track which promo codes were used. Increment `usedCount` after successful payment.

**Issue**: Trying to access driver from Order directly
**Solution**: Driver is NOT stored on Order. Access via `Order → Delivery → driverId` or use `User.driverDeliveries` for a driver's deliveries.

**Issue**: Performance issues
**Solution**: Add missing indexes, use `explain analyze` to optimize queries
